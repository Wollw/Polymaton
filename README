When launched Polymaton looks in the "Polymaton" folder in the root of the
sdcard (or equivalent) for json files defining automaton's settings.  The
path is probably going to be "/sdcard/Polymaton" and sample boards can be
found in the "Boards" directory in this repository.

Right now the program is behaving very slowly when loading boards sometimes
and other times it loads boards instantly.  I'm not sure why this is yet
and haven't really looked into it too much but it is a known issue.
